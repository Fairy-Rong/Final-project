## Introduction
Crime in Chicago has always been an issue well worth exploring, and since many of our students have a strong desire to study in the United States, understanding how to protect yourself is even more of a meaningful topic. This repository is based on the data set collected by Chicago police to do data analysis as well as streamlit app.
